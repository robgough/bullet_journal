# So, you're probably wondering...
# `system` vs `exec`
# Well, exec effectively ends this process and
# launches your new one. System returns back to
# ruby once it's finished. This may have a memory/cpu
# penalty but I'm not sure. I can worry about that later.
# (there may be an upcoming reason why I would like to
# return to ruby once vim has closed, but I'm forgetting
# it right now)

#exec "nvim #{file_name}"

puts "Bullet Journal File:"
puts "#{journal.full_path}"
system "nvim #{journal.full_path}"
