# So, you're probably wondering...
# `system` vs `exec`
# Well, exec effectively ends this process and
# launches your new one. System returns back to
# ruby once it's finished. This may have a memory/cpu
# penalty but I'm not sure. I can worry about that later.
# (there may be an upcoming reason why I would like to
# return to ruby once vim has closed, but I'm forgetting
# it right now)

#exec "nvim #{file_name}"

puts "Bullet journal file:"
puts "#{journal.full_path}"

# we can't open a file until it exists, so
# let's make sure it does
if (journal.editor == 'open')
  `touch #{journal.full_path}` unless Pathname.new(journal.full_path).exist?
